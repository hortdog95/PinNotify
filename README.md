## So, you want to be an Engineer, eh.....?

This world is filled with technologies that can enrich our lives. This technology needs stewards to oversee its creation and maintenance.  So, what do we do? We have to train our children up and pass down our knowledge.

Many of today's youngsters are **_consumers_** of these technologies, but unfortunately, they aren't all **_creators_** of the tech. The “easy” button exists on everything, while problem solving isn’t encouraged any longer. And THAT'S part of the problem. Those of us with any sort of skill need to help educate our children, even if it means dragging them kicking and screaming all of the way.  

I am married (close to 20 years) with three beautiful daughters. My 16-year-old wants to be an engineer, and is well on her way to realizing her dream. Honor Roll student, high GPA, takes tech classes at a high school that excels in teaching kids about all different kinds of technology. BUT...like most 16-year-olds today, she only wants to consume technology, and not understand it. 

Horace Mann once said:
>Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social machinery.

This repo exists as I do my part - in dragging her kicking and screaming straight into her education of being an engineer :)  It also exists as I practice some concepts that I personally know that I need some work on. That’s why you see a constructor and an interface in this class.

She's got a phone (like most kids her age) complete with fingerprint and pin authentication.  I'm going to change her PIN number and set it to a random number. In order to do that, I had to create a very simple program - a basic decryption/encryption class lib that also sends an email out to me with the new PIN.  I'll upload the beginning console app I give her to start with a bit later.
